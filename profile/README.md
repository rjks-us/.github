Hi, my name is Robert, and I develop software under the pseudonym Synosym rjks. My programming journey began with Minecraft about seven years ago. Since then, I have shifted my focus to building robust full-stack web applications primarily using Next.js and Typescript. Feel free to explore my work or get in touch if youâ€™re interested in hiring me. For more information or to contact me, visit my [Website](https://rjks.us).
